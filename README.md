## Assignment:

Develop a web application that allows users to select a date range and visualize the average temperature for that period using a graph. Implement a mechanism to store the most recent query and enable users to retrieve previous requests from a list. Employ Next.js (Progressive Web App) and make a minimal GraphQL request to fetch weather data. Utilize Storybook to manage and organize your components. Commit all changes to a GitHub repository and share an empty repository to start the project. Upon completion, schedule a video call to walk me through the code and explain the implementation details.

## Deliverables:

Completed web application in a Next.js (PWA) setup
Commit history with descriptive commit messages in a GitHub repository
Storybook configuration and organized component stories
Video call to explain the code structure and functionality
Evaluation Criteria:

**Functionality:** The application accurately retrieves weather data, calculates average temperatures, and displays the data in a clear graph.

**Code Quality:** The code is well-structured, readable, and adheres to best practices. Appropriate comments and documentation accompany the code.

**User Experience:** The application provides a user-friendly interface for selecting date ranges, viewing temperature data, and navigating past queries.

**Code Organization:** The code is organized into reusable components, utilizing Storybook for component management.

**Deployment:** The application is deployed as a PWA and is accessible via a web browser.

## Deadline:

The assignment should be completed within two days.
